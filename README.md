# Spike-and-Slab Probabilistic Backpropagation
Forked from [this repository](https://github.com/HIPS/Probabilistic-Backpropagation).

To run experiments, use `python icbinb_runner.py` and to print results, use `python icbinb_results.py`.

For the MMD comparison in the paper, use `python icbinb_simulation.py`.
